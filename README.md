# Bemoty's ShareS server

This repository contains my personal fork of the ShareX-Upload-Server (ShareS) by TannerReynolds. I use it to upload screenshots to my domain i.bemoty.dev.

## Installation

Clone this repository.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bemoty/sharex-upload-server
```

Install dependencies.

```console
npm i
```

Change `src/config.debug.json` how you want and debug the application locally using `npm run debug`.
